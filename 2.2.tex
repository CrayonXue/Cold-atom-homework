\section*{Problem 2.2}
\paragraph{} Calculate the scattering length for a three-dimensional hard core potential $V(r) = 0$ for $r>r_0$, $V(r) = -V_0$ for $r_0 > r>0$ with $V_0>0$ and $V(r) = \infty$ for r=0. Discuss how the scattering length changes as a function of $V_0$ and the difference from the square well potential above.
\paragraph{Solution:} 
In the regime $0<r<r_0$, the wave function is:
\begin{equation}
    \chi_k(r) = \sinh{\sqrt{\frac{2V_0m}{\hbar^2}}r}
\end{equation}
This is the hyperbolic sine function which strictly increase monotonically. The node as well as $a_s$ increase from $-\infty$ to $r_0$ and stay at $r_0$ for bigger $V_0$.
